This repository is a copy of the [disentanglement repository]{https://github.com/amir-abdi/disentanglement-pytorch} in pytorch,
modified to address the problem of disentanglement in multi-task learning described in ["On the relationship between disentanglement and multi-task learning"]{https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03498}
